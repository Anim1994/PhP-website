<h3>My home page is in php because I have added a method where if a user is not logged in he/she will just see the normal home page. But if they are logged in the home page will direct them to the loggeduser page after 1 second which is for logged in users.</h3>
<p> A user will not be able to logout if he is already logged out

<p> After logging out user may click a link which takes them to the homepage.
<p> if a user goes to logout link without being logged in it will display that he cannot logout since he already is.
